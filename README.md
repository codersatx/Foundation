What is Foundation
==================

It's a MVC microframework for [Appcelerator Titanium](http://appcelerator.com) that adds some niceness and code organization. Right now there are just a couple of methods, but it should give enough separation between controllers and views.

What's inside
=============

For the moment there's just what you need to get started with windows and tabs. More to come.


What's coming
=============

*    Request: JSONP support that automatically does the JSON parsing for you, passing GET parameters as dictionary.
*    Documentation build (for now, just inline doclets you can build yourself using jsdoc-toolkit).
